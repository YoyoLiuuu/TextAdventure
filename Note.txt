Check before submission:
1. Complete docstrings for all functions (and doctest)
2. Preconditions and representation invariants for all classes and functions
3. Write helper functions to eliminate duplicate code
4. For functions with randomness or files, no need for

Show location:
1. After showing full description once, don't show full.
2. Location number in the header. Unless showing number spoil location.
3. Look -> print full description of the current location
4. Each location is an instance of the Location class.

Items:
1. Inventory -> list of what the player is currently carrying
2. Each item -> an instance of the Item class
3. Player can get items in certain locations and carry them in Inventory
