You are in a study room in Robarts Library.
You are in a single-person study room in Robarts Library. The smell of stale coffee is in the air. It's very quiet in
 here. There is a whiteboard on the wall and a table in the middle of the room with one chair. There is light coming in
from a window on the wall opposite the door, and you can see the buildings across the street through it. Your things are
 strewn across the table, completely disordered. You remember coming to Robarts because it's practically beside your
dorm. There is a garbage can in the corner of the room. You cough, as if you have inhaled a lot of dust. You remember
studying for a CSC111 final before dozing off.

Outside the study room in Robarts that you woke up in is a book section. Specifically, it holds all the course material

 different courses, programs years, and difficulty. The book closest to you is for CSC108 and the book farthest is for

books look untouched, as if a cloud of dust will come out of them if opened.
