You are in the book section of Robarts library.
Outside of the study room in Robarts that you woke up is a book section. Specifically, it holds all the course material for computer science classes. There are two bookshelves facing each other that are filled with course textbooks covering different courses, programs years, and difficulty. The book closest to you is for CSC108 and the book farthest is for CSC496. There are two books slightly sticking out from the rest. Odd. The librarians are usualy very neat.
